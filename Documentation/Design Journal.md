We made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with two underlying "doodads" kind of like a shelf. 
We know the shelf will have to evenually be fastened to the doodads, otherwise it will slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide-off problem, we need to create doodads that move up and down along with player input.
The first step is to just make out doodads the move up and down with player input.
## What button should it be?
We know we're developing on mouse and keyboard
